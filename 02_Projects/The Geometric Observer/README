THE GEOMETRIC OBSERVER
Inducing Wavefunction Collapse via Alignment of the Intrinsic Vector

Date: January 3, 2026

================================================================================
OVERVIEW
================================================================================

This directory contains the experimental design, python analysis scripts, and budget proposal for testing the Geometric Observer hypothesis.

The experiment seeks to determine if a passive, non-orientable spatial geometry (a custom Möbius cavity) can induce wavefunction collapse in a standard double-slit setup without active detection or energy absorption.

EXPERIMENTAL SUMMARY
================================================================================

HYPOTHESIS:
Passing a coherent photon stream through a Möbius-Topology Waveguide will increase local vacuum shear stress, forcing photons to phase-lock and reducing interference fringe visibility compared to a control group.

METHODOLOGY (A/B TESTING):
1. Condition A (Control): Standard double-slit interference pattern in open air (with standard shielding).
2. Condition B (Variable): Double-slit interference pattern with the beam path enclosed in a grounded Copper Möbius Cavity.

KEY HARDWARE:
- 532nm DPSS Laser (5mW)
- 50um Precision Double-Slit
- Linear CMOS Sensor (TSL1401)
- Custom Copper Möbius Waveguide
