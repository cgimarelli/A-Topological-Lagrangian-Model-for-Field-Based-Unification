## THE PYTHON CORE 
The current Python implementation handles the Kuramoto Dynamics and SIMBAD 
recursive queries. This is the "Ground Truth" for the project.

To run a scan:
1. Ensure astropy and astroquery are installed.
2. Set your RA/DEC and XYZ depth in the `dark_sector_scanner` function.
3. The script will output raw Metric Tension (PULL), SIMBAD resolutions, a Metric Tension Map and Sync Stability vs XYZ Location plot.
