## THIS IS A PROTOTYPE
## KNOWN ISSUES & ROADMAP

- UI SYNC: The AI Studio frontend is currently trailing the Python core. 
  The UI may not yet support the "Automatic Drift Lock" or "Seed Safety" 
  protocols found in the raw script. Use the Python core for research data.

- SCALE LIMITS: Deep Field scans (XYZ > 10^7) currently experience 
  increased processing time due to Simbad timeout constraints.
