## THIS IS A PROTOTYPE
## REPRODUCIBILITY & SYSTEM VARIANCE
The Python logic core (located in /python core) is the primary reference for this research. 
Users may notice minor numerical discrepancies (approx. ±10%) between the Python core and the ApplicationPrototype. 

Known Causes for Variance:
- Floating-Point Drift: Minor differences in 32-bit vs. 64-bit precision across 
  different cloud architectures.
- Library Versioning: Variations in NumPy's internal Random Number Generator 
  algorithms between environments.
- Environment Sync: The UI Prototype is currently in "Draft" status and does 
  not yet implement the latest Spiral Scan oscillation logic.

For peer-reviewed data replication, always use the Python script.
