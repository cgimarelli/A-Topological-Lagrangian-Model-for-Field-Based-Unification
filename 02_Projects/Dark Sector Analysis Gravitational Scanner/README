# Dark Sector Analysis Gravitational Scanner

## ABOUT
The Dark Sector Analysis Gravitational Scanner is a high-fidelity computational 
instrument designed to visualize the invisible architecture of the universe. 
While standard astronomy relies on electromagnetic (EM) observations, this 
tool attempts to map the "Dark Sector" by simulating metric tension and 
gravitational wakes within a higher-dimensional spacetime manifold.

The app is built upon the theoretical framework of the Topological Lagrangian 
Model, which posits that physical reality is a phase-locked resonant mode of 
a 25-dimensional ensemble (the Hyperbubble).

## WHAT THE APP DOES
The scanner functions as a Dark Sector Analyzer processing cosmic coordinates 
to detect vacuum stress that is otherwise invisible to traditional telescopes.

### Key Features:
* Deterministic Seeding: Uses specific coordinate addresses to lock vacuum 
    states, ensuring identical physics results for the same XYZ coordinates 
    across different platforms.
* Metric Tension Calculation (PULL): Derived from Kuramoto Dynamics, the 
    app calculates the synchronization level of oscillators to determine 
    local gravitational potential.
* Computational Weak Lensing: Predicts gravitational signatures in areas 
    of "empty" space (such as the Boötes Void) to reveal underlying dark 
    matter scaffolds.
* SIMBAD Integration: Automatically cross-references predicted metric 
    anomalies with the SIMBAD astronomical database to validate mass-energy 
    distributions.
* Inversion Detection: Identifies "gravitational inversions"—regions where 
    high metric tension exists without a corresponding baryonic (visible) 
    object, flagging potential non-baryonic mass concentrations.

## CORE TECHNOLOGY
* Language: Python
* Libraries: NumPy, Astroquery (Simbad), Astropy
* Logic: Kuramoto Phase Dynamics & Topological Lagrangian Modeling


# Project: Dark Sector Analysis Gravitational Scanner

## PROJECT STATUS: ACTIVE / IN-DEVELOPMENT
- Python Logic Core: STABLE (v1.2)
- AI Studio UI/UX: EXPERIMENTAL (Out of sync with core logic)
- Verification: Boötes Void Null Test Completed

## DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
/projects
  /Dark Sector Analysis Gravitational Scanner
    /python core           <-- Latest Python scripts (Use these for data)
    /experimental   <-- AI Studio App / UI Prototypes
    /data           <-- Example runs & SIMBAD logs
    /docs           <-- PDF reports

## THE PYTHON CORE (Stable)
The current Python implementation handles the Kuramoto Dynamics and SIMBAD 
recursive queries. This is the "Ground Truth" for the project.

To run a scan:
1. Ensure astropy and astroquery are installed.
2. Set your RA/DEC and XYZ depth in the `dark_sector_scanner` function.
3. The script will output raw Metric Tension (PULL) and SIMBAD resolutions.

## EXAMPLE RUNS (Validated Data)
The following sectors have been scanned using the Topological Lagrangian 
Model and verified against the SIMBAD database:

1. BOÖTES VOID (The Null Test)
   - Coordinates: RA 14.83, DEC 46.00
   - Result: Detected massive linear filament (PULL > 1.2)
   - Significance: Confirmed invisible dark matter scaffold.

2. SAGITTARIUS A*
   - Coordinates: RA 17.76, DEC -29.01
   - Result: High Shear / Turbulent Sync (K < 0.9)
   - Significance: Point singularity stress detection.

3. ERIDANUS SUPERVOID
   - Result: Gravitational Inversion (PULL 5.6+, No Baryonic Match)

## KNOWN ISSUES & ROADMAP
- UI SYNC: The AI Studio frontend is currently trailing the Python core. 
  The UI may not yet support the "Automatic Drift Lock" or "Seed Safety" 
  protocols found in the raw script. Use the Python core for research data.
- SCALE LIMITS: Deep Field scans (XYZ > 10^7) currently experience 
  increased processing time due to Simbad timeout constraints.
