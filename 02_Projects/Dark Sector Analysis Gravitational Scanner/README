# Dark Sector Analysis Gravitational Scanner

## ABOUT
The Dark Sector Analysis Gravitational Scanner is a high-fidelity computational 
instrument designed to visualize the invisible architecture of the universe. 
While standard astronomy relies on electromagnetic (EM) observations, this 
tool attempts to map the "Dark Sector" by simulating metric tension and 
gravitational wakes within a higher-dimensional spacetime manifold.

The app is built upon the theoretical framework of the Topological Lagrangian 
Model, which posits that physical reality is a phase-locked resonant mode of 
a 25-dimensional ensemble (the Hyperbubble).

## WHAT THE APP DOES
The scanner functions as a Dark Sector Analyzer processing cosmic coordinates 
to detect vacuum stress that is otherwise invisible to traditional telescopes.

### Key Features:
* Deterministic Seeding: Uses specific coordinate addresses to lock vacuum 
    states, ensuring identical physics results for the same XYZ coordinates 
    across different platforms.
* Metric Tension Calculation (PULL): Derived from Kuramoto Dynamics, the 
    app calculates the synchronization level of oscillators to determine 
    local gravitational potential.
* Computational Weak Lensing: Predicts gravitational signatures in areas 
    of "empty" space (such as the Boötes Void) to reveal underlying dark 
    matter scaffolds.
* SIMBAD Integration: Automatically cross-references predicted metric 
    anomalies with the SIMBAD astronomical database to validate mass-energy 
    distributions.
* Inversion Detection: Identifies "gravitational inversions"—regions where 
    high metric tension exists without a corresponding baryonic (visible) 
    object, flagging potential non-baryonic mass concentrations.
