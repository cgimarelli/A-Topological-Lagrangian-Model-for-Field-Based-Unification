This folder contains a selection of sample data from scans ran with the python core. 
To run a scan:
1. Ensure astropy and astroquery are installed.
2. Set your RA/DEC and XYZ depth in the `dark_sector_scanner` function.
3. The script will output raw Metric Tension (PULL) and SIMBAD resolutions and graphs.
