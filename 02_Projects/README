EXPERIMENTS ON THE TOPOLOGICAL LAGRANGIAN MODEL

This directory contains the proposed laboratory protocols, hardware specifications, and budget requirements designed to empirically verify the theoretical predictions of the Hyperbottle Model.

Unlike the Library directory (which contains theoretical derivations), this directory focuses on physical falsification.

ACTIVE PROPOSALS
================================================================================

1. The Geometric Observer (Exp_01)
   Status: Proposal / Budgeting
   Objective: To determine if a passive, non-orientable spatial geometry (a Möbius cavity) can induce wavefunction collapse in a double-slit experiment without active detection.
   Key Hypothesis: Vacuum shear stress acts as a mechanical observer.

Each experiment folder contains:
- The proposal/paper.
- Python scripts for data analysis (Signal Processing).
- Raw datasets (intensity profiles, interference patterns).
- Schematics for hardware fabrication.
