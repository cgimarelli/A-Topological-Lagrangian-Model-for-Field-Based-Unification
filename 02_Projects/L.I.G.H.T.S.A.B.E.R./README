# L.I.G.H.T.S.A.B.E.R. 🌌
### Lagrangian Interferometric Gravitational High-frequency Topological Scanner for Astrophysical Beam-depth Evaluation and Resonance

## Project Overview
The L.I.G.H.T.S.A.B.E.R. project is a computational framework designed to verify Topological Lagrangian Dynamics across diverse astrophysical environments. By utilizing a high-precision deep drill spectral scanning algorithm, the project probes the metric curvature of space-time to distinguish between stable baryonic matter and high-tension metric fractures.

This repository contains the verified data logs and visual archives from a finalized N=60 target run across six distinct astrophysical regimes.

## Key Research Capabilities
* Metric Fracture Resolution: Identifying Supermassive Black Holes and Pulsars through synchronization collapse and gravitational pull analysis.
* Elemental Identity Mapping: Utilizing the Topological Mode (m) to fingerprint elemental signatures from Hydrogen through Iron.
* Dark Sector Analysis: Detecting Ghost signatures in cosmic voids and lensing clusters where m < 0.18 but gravitational tension remains significant.
* Geometric Forensic Mapping: Resolving structural phenomena such as the Dual-Blade accretion disk signatures and the Leaf Vein filaments of the Cosmic Web.

## Repository Structure
* `/plots`: 60 high-resolution PNG scans visualizing the geometry of stability across all targets.
* `FINAL_STABILITY_SCAN.txt`: The master data log containing the 300-point drill ensemble for every target coordinate.
* `Lagrangian Interferometric Gravitational High-frequency Topological Scanner for Astrophysical Beam-depth Evaluation and Resonance.pdf`: The formal research proposal and analytical execution plan.
