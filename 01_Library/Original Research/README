OVERVIEW
This directory contains the technical documentation and numerical verification scripts for the Topological Lagrangian Model (TLM) research series. Each module provides a standalone proof of specific theoretical sectors within the unified field framework.

DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
The research is organized into paired technical sets to ensure transparency and reproducibility:
> [Title of Original Research_Folder]
  >> The formal research paper on the technical paper that containing the prose, mathematical derivations, and theoretical context.
  >> The standalone numerical verification script. These audits provide the data-driven backend for the claims made in the corresponding papers.

VERIFICATION PROTOCOL
The included Python scripts provide a standardized framework for independent peer review. Each audit module is designed to validate the mathematical consistency of the corresponding theoretical sector using a consistent methodology:
> Invariance Verification: Testing the stability of metric signatures and conservation laws under topological transformations.
> Stationarity Audits: Numerically solving field equations to ensure theoretical configurations satisfy the principle of least action.
> Scaling Consistency: Verifying the numerical construction of tensors and the stability of derived coupling constants.
> Quantization Checks: Evaluating path integrals and boundary conditions to confirm the emergence of discrete physical states.

REQUIREMENTS
Python 3.x
NumPy
SciPy
